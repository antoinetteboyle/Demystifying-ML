Designed an interactive website that performs machine learning to predict the following day share price.

Selected the Top 5 Market Caps on the ASX.

We performed an ETL process to load the data to a MongoDb.

Our dataset contained over 5000 rows of daily trading datafor each ASX listed company. The machine learning model used was LSTM and Sequential Model. We performed the machine learning on each company and saved the results into MongoDb.

Each company page provides general information and an interactive visualisation.
